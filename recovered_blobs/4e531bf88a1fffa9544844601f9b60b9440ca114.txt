# Bible Story — 10 Volume Sales Page (Vite + React)

This is a minimal single-page sales site built with **Vite + React**. It includes:
- Hero section with a video canvas (triggers UI when video reaches halfway or ends)
- CTA, Social Proofs, Product Image, Benefits, Objection Handling, Endorsements, Guarantee, Quality, Transformational Promise
- Cash-on-Delivery order form with courier dropdown
- Plain CSS and detailed comments aimed at junior developers

## Quick Start (Local)
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (recommended v18+).
2. Unzip the project and open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the displayed local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Media / Public files
Place your media files in the `public/` folder (create it at the project root). Important file names used in the code:
- `public/bible-story-intro.mp4` — Your promo video (or change the path in `src/App.jsx`)
- `public/poster.jpg` — Poster image for the video
- `public/product.jpg` — Photo of the 10-volume boxed set
- `public/endorser1.jpg`, `public/endorser2.jpg`, `public/endorser3.jpg` — Endorser images

If you don't have images or a video yet, the app will still run; replace the media later.

## Build for production
```
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Developer notes
- The video triggers the sections via `onTimeUpdate` and `onEnded` handlers in `src/App.jsx`.
- The order form is demonstration-only: it logs order data to the console. Replace submission logic with your API when ready.
- CSS is intentionally simple; feel free to integrate Tailwind or a component library later.

Enjoy — and if you want enhancements (progress bar, analytics, or server-side ordering), tell me which feature to add next.
